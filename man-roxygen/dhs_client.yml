dhs_api_request:
  short: >-
    Makes a call to the DHS websites API. You canmake requests to any of their
    declared api endpoints (see \code{vignette(rdhs)} for more on these). API
    queries can be filtered by providing query terms, and you can control how
    many search results you want returned. The default paramters will return
    all of the results, and will format it nicely into a data.frame for you.
  params:
    api_endpoint: >-
      API endpoint. Must be one of the 12 possible endpoints.
    query: >-
      List of query filters. To see possible query filter terms for each endpoint
      then head to the DHS api website.
    api_key: >-
      DHS API key. Default will grab the key provided when the client was created.
    num_results: >-
      The Number of results to return. Default = "ALL" which will loop through all
      the api search results pages for you if there are more results than their API
      will allow you to fetch in one page. If you specify a number this many results
      will be returned (but probably best to just leave default).
    just_results: >-
      Boolean whetehr to return just the results or all the http API
      response. Default = TRUE (probably best again to leave as this.)
  value: >-
      Data.frame with search results if just_results=TRUE, otherwsie a nested
      list with all the API responses for each page required.

available_surveys:
  short: >-
    Searches the DHS website for all the surveys that you can donwloa.
    If the client has been created you will not have to pass in any
    parameters as these will be taken from your environment. The results
    of this function are cached.
  params:
    datasets_api_results: >-
      The list of potential datasets as declared from
      their api. The default argument fetches these so don't worry too much about
      this. Default = self$dhs_api_request("datasets",num_results = "ALL")
    surveys_api_results: >-
      The list of potential surveys as declared from
      their api. The default argument fetches these so don't worry too much about
      this. Default = self$dhs_api_request("surveys",num_results = "ALL")
  value: >-
      Data.frame object with 14 variables that detail the surveys you can download,
      their url download links and the country, survey, year etc info for that link.

download_survey:
  short: >-
    Using the output from \code{avaialable_surveys} the client will download the
    surveys you have requested. The
  params:
    output_dir_root: >-
      Root directory where the surveys will be stored within. The default will download
      surveys to a subfolder of the client root called "surveys"
    desired_survey: >-
      The desired survey to be downloaded. This represents a row(s) from \code{avaialable_surveys}.
      If multiple rows are requested the function will handle that and give you back the results
      in a list, with elements named accordingly for the survey downloaded.
    download_option: >-
      Character specifying whether the survey should be just downloaded ("zip"), extracted ("ex"),
      imported and saved as an .rds object ("rds"), or both extract and rds ("both"). Conveniently
      you can just specify any letter from these options.
    reformat: >-
      Boolean concerning whether to reformat read in datasets. Default = TRUE.
  value: >-
      Depends on the download_option requested, but ultimately it is a file path to where the survey
      was downloaded to, so that you can interact with it accordingly.

survey_questions:
  short: >-
    Use this function after download_survey to query downloaded surveys for what questions they asked.
    This function will look for the downloaded and imported survey datasets from the cache, and will
    download them if not previously downloaded.
  params:
    desired_survey: >-
      The desired surveys to be queried. This represents a row(s) from \code{avaialable_surveys}.
      If multiple rows are requested the function will handle that and give you back the results
      in a list, with elements named accordingly for the survey downloaded.
    search_terms: >-
      Character vector of search terms. If any of these terms are found within the surveys question
      descriptions, the corresponding code and description will be returned.
    regex: >-
      Regex character pattern for matching. If you want to specify your regex search pattern, then specify
      this argument. N.B. If both search_terms and regex are supplied as arguments then regex will be ignored.
    output_dir_root: >-
      Root directory where the surveys will be stored within. The default will download
      surveys to a subfolder of the client root called "surveys"
  value: >-
      Data frame of the surveys where matches were found and then all the resultant codes and descriptions.

survey_codes:
  short: >-
    Use this function after download_survey to look up all the surveys that have the provided codes.
  params:
    desired_survey: >-
      The desired surveys to be queried. This represents a row(s) from \code{avaialable_surveys}.
      If multiple rows are requested the function will handle that and give you back the results
      in a list, with elements named accordingly for the survey downloaded.
    codes: >-
      Character vector of codes to be looked up
    essential_codes: >-
      Character vector of codes that need to present. If any of the codes are not present n that survey,
      the survey will not be returned by this functon. Default = NULL.
  value: >-
      Data frame of the surveys where matches were found and then all the resultant codes and descriptions.

extract:
  short: >-
    Function to extract datasets using a set of survey questions as taken from the output from \code{survey_questions}
  params:
    questions: >-
      Questions to be queried, in the format from \code{survey_questions}
    add_geo: >-
      Add geograpic information to the extract. Defaut = TRUE


get_cache_date:
  short: >-
      Returns the private member variable cache-date, which is the date
      the client was last created/valiated against the DHS API.
  value: >-
      POSIXct and POSIXt time

set_cache_date:
  short: >-
      Sets the private member variable cache-date, which is the date
      the client was last created/valiated against the DHS API. This should
      never really be needed but is icluded to demonstrate the cache clearing
      properties of the client in the vignette.
  params:
    date: POSIXct and POSIXt time to update cache time to.

save_client:
  short: >-
    Internally save the client object as an .rds file within the root
    directory for the client.

clear_namespace:
  short: >-
    Clear the keys and values associated within a cache context. The dhs client
